**SynState** is a lightweight, high-performance, type-safe state management library for TypeScript/JavaScript applications. Perfect for building reactive global state and event-driven systems in React, Vue, and other frameworks.

## Features

- 🎯 **Simple State Management**: Easy-to-use `createState` and `createReducer` similar to React useState/useReducer for global state
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for fast state updates and minimal re-renders
- 🎨 **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with precise type inference
- 🚀 **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size with only one external runtime dependency ([ts-data-forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-data-forge))
- 🌐 **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JavaScript
- 🔄 **Reactive Updates**: Automatic propagation of state changes to all subscribers
- 📡 **Event System**: Built-in `createValueEmitter`, `createEventEmitter` for event-driven architecture
- 🔧 **Observable-based**: Built on Observable pattern similar to RxJS, but with a completely independent implementation from scratch — not a wrapper. Offers optional advanced features like operators (`map`, `filter`, `scan`, `debounce`) and combinators (`merge`, `combine`)
