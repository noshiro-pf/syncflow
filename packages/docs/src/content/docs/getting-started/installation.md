```bash
npm add synstate
```

Or with other package managers:

```bash
# Yarn
yarn add synstate

# pnpm
pnpm add synstate
```

### React Hooks

If you are using React, install the companion hooks package:

```bash
npm add synstate-react-hooks
```

`synstate-react-hooks` includes all exports from `synstate` plus the `createState`, `createReducer`, and `createBooleanState` APIs extended for React, so you don't need to add `synstate` along with it.

### Preact Hooks

If you are using Preact, install the companion hooks package:

```bash
npm add synstate-preact-hooks
```
