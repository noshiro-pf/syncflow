**SynState** is a lightweight, high-performance, type-safe state management library for TypeScript/JavaScript applications. Perfect for building reactive global state and event-driven systems in React, Vue, and other frameworks.

"SynState" is named after "Synchronized + State." It represents a sound synchronized state through a **glitch-free** Observable implementation.

## Features

- 🎯 **Simple State Management**: Easy-to-use `createState` and `createReducer` similar to React `useState`/`useReducer` for global state
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized for fast state updates and minimal re-renders
- 🎨 **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with precise type inference
- 🚀 **Lightweight**: <!-- bundle-size:synstate -->~4.2 kB min+gzip<!-- /bundle-size:synstate --> with only one external runtime dependency ([ts-data-forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-data-forge))
- 🌐 **Framework Agnostic**: Works with React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript
- 🔄 **Reactive Updates**: Automatic propagation of state changes to all subscribers
- 📡 **Event System**: Built-in `createValueEmitter`, `createEventEmitter` for event-driven architecture
- 🔧 **Observable-based**: Built on Observable pattern similar to RxJS, but with a completely independent implementation from scratch — not a wrapper. Offers optional advanced features like operators (`map`, `filter`, `scan`, `debounce`) and combinators (`merge`, `combine`)

## Quick Example

With a single call to `createState`, you can add global state to your application:

```tsx
import { createState } from 'synstate';

// Create a reactive state
const [state, setState] = createState(0);

// Subscribe to changes
state.subscribe((count) => {
    console.log(count); // 0, 1
});

// Update state
setState(1);
```

`createState` creates a reactive state and a setter function. Subscribers are notified immediately with the initial value, and again whenever the state is updated.

Although `createState` looks similar to React's `useState`, it is fundamentally different. The first element of the return value is an `InitializedObservable<T>` — a specialized Observable provided by SynState that always holds an initial value — not a plain value. `createState` does not work correctly inside React components (which are re-evaluated on every render) and must be called at the global scope.

```ts
import type * as React from 'react';
import { createState } from 'synstate';

// Create a reactive state

const SomeComponent = (): React.JSX.Element => {
    const [state, setState] = createState(0); // 🚫 Don't do this!!!

    // ...
};
```

To use it with React, you need to subscribe to the `InitializedObservable` inside your components — via `useSyncExternalStore` (React 18+) or `useState` + `useEffect` (React 17 and earlier). But don't worry: SynState provides `synstate-react-hooks`, a companion package that handles this for you. With it, you can introduce global state that is easily subscribable inside React components:

```tsx
import type * as React from 'react';
import { createState } from 'synstate-react-hooks';

const [useUserState, setUserState] = createState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
});

const UserProfile = (): React.JSX.Element => {
    const user = useUserState();

    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                {'Name: '}
                {user.name}
            </p>
            <button
                onClick={() => {
                    setUserState({
                        name: 'Alice',
                        email: 'alice@example.com',
                    });
                }}
            >
                {'Set User'}
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

By using global state instead of React's `useState`, it becomes easy to hold application state that spans beyond a single component — such as [Dark Mode toggling](/synstate/examples/react/#boolean-state-dark-mode) or [Cross-Component Communication](/synstate/examples/react/#cross-component-communication).
